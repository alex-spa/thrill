# Thrill [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ozanturgut/thrill.png)](http://travis-ci.org/ozanturgut/thrill)

Thrill runs tests in browsers.

## Central & Automated
One server captures browsers for anyone in the network to run tests on. Automatically
populate the pool using Selenium Grid, Sauce Labs, or Browser Stack. Choose which
browsers should run your tests based on user-agent or feature set (anything that Modernizr can detect).

## Simple
Thrill can automatically detect and inject it's adapter during test-time for test
suites using QUnit, jasmine, mocha, or YUI. This means minimal or no configuration
to run your test suite.

## Flexible
Run Thrill via the command-line, grunt, or within your own application. 
Use the simple API to write your own adapters and reporters. Report tests 
using mocha's many reporters, regardless of the testing framework you're using.
