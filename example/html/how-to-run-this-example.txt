HTML Example

This example will show you how you can run an HTML document which has your tests using Thrill.

1) Start a queen server: queen -h localhost:9200 -c localhost:9000
2) Capture a browser by navigating to http://localhost:9000 
3) Start Thrill from this directory: thrill -h localhost:9200 test.html

Here's what happened:
1) You started the Queen server, and configured it to start listening for browsers to capture on
localhost:9000, and to listen for remote connections on localhost:9200.

2) You captured a browser by going to the capture point (localhost:9000).

3) You started Thrill, telling it to connect to the Queen Server on localhost:9200. You provided
Thrill with an HTML document, so Thrill read the HTML document, and found the furthest-most parent
directory it refers to (which is the current directory in this case). It the started up an HTTP server,
and began serving requests for the document. Then, it contacted the Queen server and asked for it to 
have the HTML document to be loaded on all of its connected browsers. 

While serving the HTML document, Thrill will check to see if there's a library in it that it can 
adapt automatically. Since this document we requests to run uses QUnit, and Thrill can adapt to 
QUnit, it will automatically inject it's adapter during the request. Note that the actual HTML 
file is never modified and never knows of Thrill's existance, Thrill does all of this at the 
HTTP server level.
