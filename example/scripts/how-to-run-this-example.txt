Scripts Example

This example will show you how you can run test scripts using Thrill, without the 
need for an HTML document.

1) Start a queen server: queen -h localhost:9200 -c localhost:9000
2) Capture a browser by navigating to http://localhost:9000 
3) Start Thrill from this directory: thrill -h localhost:9200

Here's what happened:
1) You started the Queen server, and configured it to start listening for browsers to capture on
localhost:9000, and to listen for remote connections on localhost:9200.

2) You captured a browser by going to the capture point (localhost:9000).

3) You started Thrill, telling it to connect to the Queen Server on localhost:9200. Since you provided
no filenames, Thrill automatically checked for and found a thrill.js file in the directory. This
file instructed Thrill to run qunit.js, test1.js, and test2.js in order. Thrill then started started
an HTTP server to serve these files, and then sent a request to the Queen server to have all of it's
browsers execute the three files in order and report on the status of the tests.

Now try executing this from this folder: thrill -h localhost:9200 qunit.js test1.js test2.js

This achieves the very same thing, but without the configuration file (since all it did was
list the three files anyways).
